# Express Finance
This is my 2nd project for SEI bootcamp at General Assembly

## About the application
Web application for portfolio, tracking stocks, markets, and financial news. Real-Time stock, currencies and crypto information using Finnhub Stock API. The free API allows for access to several features like company news, basic financials, company earnings, crypto exchanges and symbols etc. Visit http://finnhub.io for more information.

## Features
*  Users can login and create a portfolio containing a list of stocks they own and view a snapshot of how their portfolio is  perfmorming.
*  Users can create a watchlist of stocks they are interested in.
*  User can read financial news about the company.

## Setting up the project
The application uses the following technologies/frameworks :
* axios
* node/express/ejs/express-ejs-layouts
* postgresql

Additional node packages are also needed :
* finnhub.js
* sequelize
* dotenv

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

You will need the following keys in the .env file.
* PORT - describes the port you are using
* SECRET_KEY - for encrypting userid
* API_TOKEN - https://finnhub.io/ API token key. the token can be obtained for free at finnhub.com
* SANDBOX_API_TOKEN - sandbox API token key for testing endpoints. also from finnhub.io
* ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY - API token from https://www.alphavantage.co/. This is used for searching stocks.
* STOCKDATA_TOKEN - API token from https://www.stockdata.org/

Database/Models
* The application is using PostgreSQL. Postgresql should be installed. Once installed, create a new database named `express_finance`
* Run the sequelize scripts in `createModel.txt` to create models.


A free API key must be obtained from finnhub.io. This API key will be stored in the .env file. (Read `Changes` section at the bottom of the page.)
